      <p>
        D. Loriston Scott is an author, playwright and produced screenwriter.
      </p>
      <p>
        After humble beginnings of being raised in Summit N.J. and moving to Detroit MI, to attend High School, Loriston joined the military to serve his country and after an honorable discharge as a Marine Corpsman he chose to stay in LA and pursue
        an acting career.
        His dashing good looks were soon noticed, and he was being groomed for a TV career in the early nineties making appearances on such shows as: Picket Fences, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and Blossom. However, his calling wasn’t in front of the
        camera and he chose to quit acting. "In this town people think you’re crazy to turn down something like that," he said. "They can't believe you just don't enjoy being the "next big thing".
      </p>
      <p>
        Following in his idols footsteps as John Cassavetes and Spike Lee, He chose to get behind the camera as a screenwriter and director.
        While studying in film school a spotlight crashed down on the set injuring his hand and he was rushed to the campus clinic. As he regained conciousness, laying there, being treated by the nurse, their eyes met. After a whirlwind romance, the
        self proclaimed bachelor (rumored to have been romantically linked to various celebrities and socialites), tied the knot to his Florence Nightingale in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly thereafter his first screenplay, “Wonderland” starring Val Kilmer was released by Lion's Gate.
        With check in hand he wanted to give back to the community. So, when he wasn’t directing a film, he volunteered at the YMCA to exercise seniors.
        Wanting to transition from film to live theater, he auditioned and was cast in A FEW GOOD MEN and PRELUDE TO A KISS. Shortly after, his first play, SPAGHETTI WESTERN, was published by Art Age.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, along with philanthropist, TV and stage veteran actress Jane Zachary they started “It’s a B.L.A.S.S.T.” Productions. Which, provided at your door Broadway plays for the senior community throughout southern California. Sadly, that
        venture had to be put on hold, due to COVID 19, but it’s only an intermission.
        In his leisure years, Loriston has chosen to author his war chest of unproduced screenplays into novellas like RESULTS GUARANTEED that will make you laugh. BULL, that will make you think and his latest horror short, SQUEAK, that will make you
        scream.  In his spare time he enjoys sleeping in late, exercising, fine dining, exercising, tennis, exercising, motorcycle racing, exercising, watching film noir classics (hence the B & W photos), exercising, writing and of course exercising.
